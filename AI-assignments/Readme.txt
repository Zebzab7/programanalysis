Installation

Make sure you have an JDK installed. 
Make sure all 3 files main, AI and Game is in a project to be run together. 
The main file runs the program.
The AI is in the AI.java file 
The Game is in the Game.java file

Open the main.java file and run the file. This can be done from Eclipse by running the file main.java. 


When the game starts it will ask 2 question where y/n answers are expected, firstly will you enable the AI
or will you play against a human opponent, from there it will ask if the ai should fight against itself. 
Then you can play, which is shown in the terminal as:

P2 -> |6|   |5|   |4| 	|3| 	|2| 	|1| 
  0    4     4     4  	 4   	 4   	 4
       4     4     4 	 4   	 4 	 4      0 
      |1|   |2|   |3|   |4|     |5|     |6|   <- P1

Where bottom is Player1, shown as P1 and move 1-6 is shown as what space is accessed with the buttons 1-6.
The same goes for Player2 however the spaces are reverse in placement compared to P1.
